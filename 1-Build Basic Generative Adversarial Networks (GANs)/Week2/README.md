# Activations (Basic Properties)

### Elements of a Neural Network 

- **Input Layer:** This layer accepts input features. It provides information from the outside world to the network, no computation is performed at this layer, nodes here just pass on the information(features) to the hidden layer. 

- **Hidden Layer:** Nodes of this layer are not exposed to the outer world, they are part of the abstraction provided by any neural network. The hidden layer performs all sorts of computation on the features entered through the input layer and transfers the result to the output layer. 

- **Output Layer:** This layer bring up the information learned by the network to the outer world.

### What is an activation function and why use them? 

- The activation function decides whether a neuron should be activated or not by calculating the weighted sum and further adding bias to it.
- The purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron.
